# Time Tracking Application

The Time Tracking application is a open source project aimed at helping individuals and teams manage their time effectively, increase productivity, and reduce procrastination. The application incorporates key features that allow users to create tasks, track their progress, and leverage the [concept of flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) to enhance their productivity.


## Features

Key Features:

- Task Creation: The application enables users to create tasks and assign them specific attributes such as due dates, priorities, and labels for easy categorization. Users can add detailed descriptions, set reminders, and allocate estimated time for each task.

- Task Progress Tracking: Once a task is created, users can track its progress within the application. The progress can be updated manually or automatically based on various parameters, such as time spent on the task or completion of subtasks. This feature provides users with a visual representation of their progress, motivating them to stay focused and complete tasks efficiently.

- Room Database Integration: All task-related data is stored using the Room database, a robust and efficient library provided by Android. This ensures secure storage of tasks and allows for seamless retrieval and manipulation of task data.

- Fragment-Based Architecture: The application is designed using the fragment-based architecture pattern, which enhances performance and reduces the app size by approximately 50%. This architecture enables modular development and smooth navigation within the application, providing users with a seamless and responsive user experience.

- User Interface (UI) Design: The Time Tracking application boasts a user-friendly and intuitive UI. The interface is designed with careful consideration of best practices in UI/UX design, ensuring that users can easily navigate, create, and manage tasks without confusion or unnecessary complexity.

- Flow Concept Integration: The project draws inspiration from the concept of flow, a psychological state where individuals are fully immersed and focused on a task, experiencing a sense of energized focus and enjoyment. The application aims to create an environment that fosters flow by providing users with the necessary tools and features to eliminate distractions, set clear goals, and track progress, ultimately enhancing their productivity and reducing procrastination.
